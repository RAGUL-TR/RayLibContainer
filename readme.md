## üïπÔ∏è Building Your First Project

Once your environment is set up, you can start building your first game project. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir my_first_game
   cd my_first_game
   ```

2. **Create a Basic Main File**: Create a file named `main.c` and add the following code:
   ```c
   #include <raylib.h>

   int main(void)
   {
       const int screenWidth = 800;
       const int screenHeight = 450;

       InitWindow(screenWidth, screenHeight, "Hello Raylib");

       while (!WindowShouldClose())
       {
           BeginDrawing();
           ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);
           DrawText("Hello, Raylib!", 190, 200, 20, LIGHTGRAY);
           EndDrawing();
       }

       CloseWindow();
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. **Compile Your Project**: Use the following command to compile your project:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o my_first_game -lraylib -lm -lpthread -ldl -lrt -lX11
   ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running Your Project

To run your project, execute the following command in your project directory:
```bash
